# Cooking_Overtime
<p>This repository contains the project "Polypoke," a game inspired by Pok√©mon Go, developed to apply our knowledge in Node.js. Since the original repository was hosted on the university's GitLab and I was not the owner, I have imported a copy here to my personal GitHub. Please note that I only have one commit because this is a migration from the university's repository.</p>
